# Lindblad_tomography

In this repository, you can find the matlab-based code used for estimating SPAM errors, Kraus operators and Lindblad operators in the article "Lindblad Tomography of a Superconducting Quantum Processor" by G.O. Samach et al. (arXiv:2105.02338). 
In order to run the code, data has to be provided. The specific experimental data used in (arXiv:2105.02338) may be made available upon reasonable request of the corresponding authors and with the permission of the US Government sponsors who funded the work.
